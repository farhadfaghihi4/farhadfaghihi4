### Hello,

- My name is Farhad Faghihi. I am a master's graduate in biotechnology from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am focused on exploiting high-throughput sequencing for discovering the hidden aspects of cancer to harness this lethal disease.
- ðŸ‘€ I am especially keen on utilizing state-of-the-art bioinformatics strategies and tools to analyze the sequenced data of cancer cells and decipher their vulnerable points to restrain the disease.
- ðŸ¥¼ Iâ€™m looking forward to starting my Ph.D. program in cancer therapy.
